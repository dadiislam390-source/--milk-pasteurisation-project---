# 🥛 Milk Pasteurization Project

## 🔍 Project Description
This project explores the process of milk pasteurization—a critical step in dairy processing that ensures milk is safe for consumption and has an extended shelf life. Pasteurization involves heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period to eliminate harmful pathogens and spoilage organisms without compromising nutritional quality.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the science and history behind pasteurization.
- Simulate or model the pasteurization process using data or code.
- Design an interactive dashboard to track temperature, time, and microbial reduction.
- Evaluate public health and quality control implications.

## ⚙️ Process Overview
- **Heating Phase**: Milk is heated to 72°C (161°F) for 15 seconds (HTST method) or 63°C (145°F) for 30 minutes (LTLT method).
- **Holding Phase**: Temperature is maintained to ensure microbial destruction.
- **Cooling Phase**: Milk is rapidly cooled to below 4°C to prevent recontamination.
- **Packaging**: Pasteurized milk is sealed in sterile containers and labeled according to safety standards.
